De-identification of data is a challenge and after research through a  method of probe and mistakes with a variety of libraries, one has been identified as a winner, which is Microsoft Presidio https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/

This project contains a code that de-identifies all the data that would be needed to address all possible data constrains within the US region with a combination of pre-build as well as custom entities.
